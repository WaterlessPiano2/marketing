## Summary

This article will outline how customs will work between Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) or European Union (EU) Member States.

## EU-GB Imports

EU Member States are now treated as Rest of the World (RoW) for customs purposes in GB from 1 January 2021 and customs declarations are now required for the import of goods from the EU.
Goods sent to GB from EU Member States may be liable to customs duty and/or any applicable duty and/or VAT reliefs available to RoW goods.
There are facilitations and easements for goods moving through certain locations under Staged Controls when goods are sent from EU Member States.

## GB-EU Exports

Customs declarations are now required for the export of goods to the EU from 1 January 2021.
There are facilitations and easements for goods moving through certain locations under Staged Controls.

## GB-NI movements

Export declarations are not required in GB for the direct movement of goods from GB to NI from 1 January 2021.

### GB-NI Indirect movements

**GB-EU-NI:** A GB export declaration followed by an EU import declaration will be required (the GB Tariff does not provide guidance on EU import declarations). Goods can then move freely into NI.
**GB-NI-EU:** An NI import declaration will be required for the GB-NI movement followed by free movements from NI into the EU.

## NI-GB movements

Import declarations are not required for the direct movement of goods from NI-GB from 1 January 2021, provided those goods were in free circulation in NI and are not EU goods moved via NI for the purposes of avoiding UK duty. Where the movement involves goods intended for a Special Procedure in GB.

### NI-GB Indirect movements

**NI-IE-GB:** An export declaration (indirect export from NI) will be required in NI to move goods to GB via Ireland (IE), followed by an import declaration in GB as per GB Staged Controls. No customs duty is payable on NI-IE-GB movements, provided that the goods are ‘qualifying goods’, i.e., were in free circulation in NI prior to starting their movement, are itemised in a travel document issued in the UK  
which specifies the destination of the goods and were not moved via EU for the purposes of avoiding UK duty. This means that, where frontier declarations are submitted for NI-IE-GB movements, importers or their agents should use override codes to suppress the customs duty calculation.

In CHIEF, this can be done by entering code ‘DTY’ in SADH Box 47c. VAT override code ‘VAT’ should be used to suppress the import VAT charge and the supplier should account for VAT on their quarterly VAT return.

If importers have used ‘staged controls’ in GB to make an entry in their own records, the same process for suppressing customs duty and VAT calculation should be followed when supplementary declarations are submitted (using the override codes shown above).

**EU-NI-GB:** EU originating goods will need an export or indirect export to be submitted to exit from NI but will not need to be followed by a GB import declaration, unless controlled goods are being moved. If the EU goods are ‘qualifying goods’ (i.e. in free circulation prior to starting their movement) and were not moved via NI for the purposes of avoiding UK customs duty, no import declaration will be required. There is an exception for excise goods. An import declaration in GB is required for all excise goods that started their journey in the EU. If the goods are ‘qualifying goods’ for customs purposes, (and provided the goods were not moved via NI for an avoidance purpose) then no customs duty is payable. If UK excise duty has already been paid on the goods it will not be liable in GB for this movement.

## Safety and Security (ICS)

Import safety and security declarations (Entry Summary Declaration - ENS) are currently required for goods imported into GB from non-EU countries.
Export safety and security declarations (Export Summary Declaration – EXS) are currently required for goods sent to non-EU countries.
Under staged controls, there is no requirement to submit an import safety and security declaration (ENS) for imports from the EU for a period of six months after the UK leaves the transitional phase (1 January 2021 to 30 Jun 2021). From 1 July 2021 import safety and security declarations will be required for goods sent to the UK from an EU MS.

Export safety and security declarations (EXS) will be required from 1 January 2021 - In most cases these are part of a combined export declaration and safety and security declaration.

### Safety and security exit declarations

Where an export declaration is not submitted before departure, a standalone exit summary declaration (EXS) may be needed.

A standalone EXS declaration will be required if:

• an empty container is being moved under a transport contract (a transport contract, or contract of carriage, is an agreement between a carrier and shipper or passenger, setting out each party’s duties and rights)

• the goods have remained in temporary storage for more than 14 days

• the goods have remained in temporary storage for less than 14 days but the import S&S declaration details are unknown or where the destination or consignee details change

• the goods are moved under transit using a Transit Accompanying Document (TAD) or Transit and Safety and Security Declaration (TSADs) – TSADs cannot be used to meet S&S requirements in GB from 1 January 2021

A standalone EXS declaration will not be required if empty pallets and containers are moved out of GB not under a transport contract.
